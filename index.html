                        <p>
                            Oliver Marks has just served ten years for the murder of one of his closest friends - a
                            murder
                            he
                            may or may not have committed. On the day he's released, he's greeted by the detective who
                            put
                            him in prison.
                            Detective Colborne is retiring, but before he does, he wants to know what really happened
                            ten
                            years ago.
                            Through out the books twist and turns, you get to see the beauty of a tragedy, and the
                            horror of
                            love.

                <h3> About</h3>
                <p>I live somewhere between candlelight and wildflowers — where stories breathe softly and time slows
                    down. <br>
                    Books have always been more than paper to me; they are small sanctuaries, places where ink becomes
                    memory and silence becomes company. <br>
                    This space is my quiet corner of the world — a digital nook for those who find beauty in forgotten
                    pages, in moss-covered stones, and in the gentle ache of nostalgia. <br>
                    Here, I collect words that linger, images that hum quietly, and moments that feel like late
                    afternoon sunlight through an old window. <br>
                    If you've ever read by candlelight, or found comfort in the smell of old books, then welcome.
                    You've found your place among the pages
