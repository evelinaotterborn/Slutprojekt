            <p>Oliver Marks has just served ten years for the murder of one of his closest friends - a murder he may or
                may not have committed. On the day he's released, he's greeted by the detective who put him in prison.
                Detective Colborne is retiring, but before he does, he wants to know what really happened ten years
                ago.As a young actor studying Shakespeare at an elite arts conservatory, Oliver noticed that his
                talented classmates seem to play the same roles onstage and off - villain, hero, tyrant, temptress -
                though Oliver felt doomed to always be a secondary character in someone else's story. But when the
                teachers change up the casting, a good-natured rivalry turns ugly, and the plays spill dangerously over
                into life. When tragedy strikes, one of the seven friends is found dead. The rest face their greatest
                acting challenge yet: convincing the police, and themselves, that they are blameless.</p>

            <p>Todd Anderson and his friends at Welton Academy can hardly believe how different life is since their new
                English professor, the flamboyant John Keating, has challenged them to 'make your lives extraordinary!
                Inspired by Keating, the boys resurrect the Dead Poets Society -- a secret club where, free from the
                constraints and expectations of school and parents, they let their passions run wild.

                As Keating turns the boys on to the great words of Byron, Shelley, and Keats, they discover not only the
                beauty of language, but the importance of making each moment count. But the Dead Poets pledges soon
                realize that their newfound freedom can have tragic consequences. Can the club and the individuality it
                inspires survive the pressure from authorities determined to destroy their dreams?</p>

                Gets Cold <br> Toshikazu Kawaguchi</a>
            <p>explores the age-old question: what would you do if you could travel back in time? More importantly, who
                would you want to meet, maybe for one last time?In a cosy back alley in Tokyo, there is a cafe which has
                been serving carefully brewed coffee for more than one hundred years. But this coffee shop offers its
                customers a unique experience: the chance to travel back in time.Prepare to meet four visitors, each of
                whom is hoping to make use of the cafe’s time-travelling offer in order to:- confront the man who left
                them- receive a letter from their husband whose memory has been taken by Alzheimer's- see their sister
                one last time, and- meet the daughter they never got the chance to know.But the journey into the past
                does not come without risks: customers must sit in a particular seat, they cannot leave the cafe, and
                finally, they must return to the present before the coffee gets cold . . .‘</p>

        <p>As children, sisters Gillian and Sally were forever outsiders in their small New England town, teased,
            taunted and shunned for the air of magic that seems to sparkle in the air around them. All Gillian and Sally
            ever wanted was to get away. And eventually they do – one marries, the other runs as far from home as she
            can manage.Years later, however, tragedy will bring the sisters back together. And they’ll find that no
            matter what else may happen, they’ll always have each other.</p>

        <p>Born into a family of successful pilots, Morag is used to flying high. But when a tragic accident above the
            clouds grounds her, could the future she'd always imagined be suddenly out of reach?When she receives a call
            telling her that her beloved grandfather has been taken ill, Morag leaves her fast-paced life in London to
            return home to the tranquil Scottish Highlands. With her grandfather out of action, Morag has no choice but
            to take over flying the local route in his rickety old plane, ferrying locals across the beautiful islands
            of the archipelago. But as the weather takes a dramatic turn, Morag is forced to crash-land on a remote
            island and suddenly finds herself far from civilisation and all alone. Then she discovers Gregor, the gruff
            and reclusive ornithologist taking care of the island for the season. Though the pair don't see eye to eye,
            Morag is forced to seek shelter at his cabin and it seems the pair are stuck together until help arrives.
            However long that may be . . .As she awaits rescue, might Morag discover that a remote Scottish island, cut
            off from real-life, is exactly the place she needs to be?</p>
