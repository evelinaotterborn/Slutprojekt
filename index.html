                    <p>                      
                        Oliver Marks has just served ten years for the murder of one of his closest friends - a murder he
                        may or may not have committed. On the day he's released, he's greeted by the detective who put him in prison.
                        Detective Colborne is retiring, but before he does, he wants to know what really happened ten years ago.
                        Through out the books twist and turns, you get to see the beauty of a tragedy, and the horror of love.

                        their

                        English professor, the flamboyant John Keating, has challenged them to 'make your lives
                        extraordinary!
                        Inspired by Keating, the boys resurrect the Dead Poets Society -- a secret club where, free from
                        the
                        constraints and expectations of school and parents, they let their passions run wild.</p>

                <h3> About</h3>
                <p>I live somewhere between candlelight and wildflowers — where stories breathe softly and time slows
                    down.
                    Books have always been more than paper to me; they are small sanctuaries, places where ink becomes
                    memory and silence becomes company.
                    This space is my quiet corner of the world — a digital nook for those who find beauty in forgotten
                    pages, in moss-covered stones, and in the gentle ache of nostalgia.
                    Here, I collect words that linger, images that hum quietly, and moments that feel like late
                    afternoon sunlight through an old window.
                    If you've ever read by candlelight, or found comfort in the smell of old books, then welcome.
                    You've found your place among the pages
